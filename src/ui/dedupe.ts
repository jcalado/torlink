// The same torrent reaches the list from several sources at once, and only one
// row should survive. The healthiest row still wins — its seeder count is the
// one worth showing — but the rows it beats are folded into it instead of being
// dropped:
//
//   - their announce lists. 1337x and EZTV hand back the torrent's own
//     trackers, while rows built by buildMagnet() carry only torlink's public
//     defaults, so keeping the higher-seeder row alone can trade a working
//     announce list for a generic one. Same loss #146 fixed for a .torrent
//     file's own trackers.
//   - numFiles and added, but only where the winner has none. A field the
//     winner never reported is a gap, not a decision.
//
// Everything else stays the winner's, including its magnet URI byte for byte.
